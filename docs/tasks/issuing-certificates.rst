====================
Issuing Certificates
====================

The Certificate resource type is used to request certificates from different
Issuers.

In order to issue any certificates, you'll need to configure an Issuer resource
first.

If you have not configured any issuers yet, you should read the
:doc:`Setting up Issuers <./issuers/index>` guide.
